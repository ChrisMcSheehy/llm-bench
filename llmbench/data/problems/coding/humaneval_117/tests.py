"""Held-out tests for HumanEval/117, from OpenAI's HumanEval (MIT). See HUMANEVAL.md.

`check` below is HumanEval's own, unmodified. The wrapper at the bottom is this
project's: the harness runs pytest against a module called `solution`, so the
candidate is imported from there and handed to `check` exactly as HumanEval intends.

The wildcard import is not laziness. A handful of these problems state a helper in
the prompt - `poly`, `encode_cyclic`, `encode_shift` - and HumanEval's own `check`
calls that helper directly as well as the candidate. Importing only the entry point
left those three failing with a NameError raised by the test rather than by the
answer. The explicit import below it is kept because it is the contract with the
model, and it fails with a readable name when the model ignores it.
